<h1>Numerical System Converter</h1>

A program made for my systems class entirely in python using the tkinter toolkit that converts one numerical system into another.

The following systems include 
<ul>
  <li>Decimal</li>
  <li>Binary</li>
  <li>Octal</li>
  <li>Hexadecimal</li>
</ul>

<h2>Build Info</h2>

An executable can be created by running ```pyinstaller -F main.py``` in the <b>root folder</b>.

The executable can be found in the /dist folder.
